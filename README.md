#Eye-Controlled Mouse Using OpenCV and MediaPipe
This project implements an eye-controlled mouse using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI. The program uses your webcam to track eye movements and control the mouse cursor on your screen. It also detects blinks to simulate mouse clicks.
#Features
Real-time Face and Eye Tracking: Uses MediaPipe's FaceMesh solution to track facial landmarks.
Cursor Control: Maps eye movements to screen coordinates to move the cursor.
Blink Detection: Detects blinks to perform mouse clicks.
Live Video Feed: Displays the live video feed with tracked facial landmarks for visual feedback.
